    "title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
    "subtitle": "Common questions about the Metro Yukthi system implementation",
    "questions": {
      "data_sources": {
        "question": "What data sources does the system integrate with?",
        "answer": "The system integrates with fitness certification databases, Maximo job-card systems, branding management platforms, mileage tracking systems, cleaning slot schedulers, and depot bay status monitors. It also includes synthetic data generation capabilities for testing and validation scenarios."
      },
      "deployment": {
        "question": "What is the deployment model for the system?",
        "answer": "The system is designed for on-premises deployment within secure government infrastructure. It operates as a containerized microservice architecture with nightly batch processing cycles and real-time monitoring capabilities. Cloud deployment options are available with appropriate security compliance."
      },
      "security": {
        "question": "How does the system ensure data security and compliance?",
        "answer": "The system implements end-to-end encryption, role-based access controls, audit logging, and compliance with government data protection standards. All ML models operate on anonymized datasets, and sensitive information is protected through advanced cryptographic methods."
      },
      "audit_trails": {
        "question": "What audit trails and governance features are available?",
        "answer": "Complete decision traceability with timestamped logs, explainable AI outputs showing decision rationale, change management workflows, approval processes for critical decisions, and comprehensive reporting dashboards for regulatory compliance and operational oversight."
      },
      "override_governance": {
        "question": "Can operators override system recommendations and how is this governed?",
        "answer": "Yes, operators can override recommendations through a structured workflow requiring justification, supervisor approval, and documented reasoning. All overrides are logged, tracked for pattern analysis, and incorporated into model learning cycles while maintaining human oversight authority."
      },
      "maximo_integration": {
        "question": "How does the system integrate with existing Maximo infrastructure?",
        "answer": "The system connects to Maximo through standard APIs and real-time data synchronization. It reads job-card status, maintenance schedules, and asset conditions while writing back recommendations and status updates. Custom integration adapters ensure seamless data flow and minimal disruption to existing workflows."
